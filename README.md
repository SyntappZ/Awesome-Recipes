food recipe website using the edamam api was very disapointing as the restrictions for free accounts are letting me use any
filters for the food and only alowed 5 searches per minute is pretty bad, my plan was to have search by cuisine and search by food type but iv had to remove all that now due to the restrictions so now i have just put this project down to design practice as i still need to work on that.
